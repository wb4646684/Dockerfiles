// for convenience

/* Plugin for jQuery for working with colors.
 * 
 * Version 1.1.
 * 
 * Inspiration from jQuery color animation plugin by John Resig.
 *
 * Released under the MIT license by Ole Laursen, October 2009.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *   $.color.parse("#fff").scale('rgb', 0.25).add('a', -0.5).toString()
 *   var c = $.color.extract($("#mydiv"), 'background-color');
 *   console.log(c.r, c.g, c.b, c.a);
 *   $.color.make(100, 50, 25, 0.4).toString() // returns
 *   "rgba(100,50,25,0.4)"
 *
 * Note that .scale() and .add() return the same modified object
 * instead of making a new one.
 *
 * V. 1.1: Fix error handling so e.g. parsing an empty string does
 * produce a color rather than just crashing.
